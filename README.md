# Implementation of Logistic Regression Model for Classifying Food Choices for Diabetic Patients

## AIM:
To implement a logistic regression model to classify food items for diabetic patients based on nutrition information.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Import necessary libraries.
   
2.Load the dataset using pd.read_csv().

3.Display data types, basic statistics, and class distributions.

4.Visualize class distributions with a bar plot.

5.Scale feature columns using MinMaxScaler.

6.Encode target labels with LabelEncoder.

7.Split data into training and testing sets with train_test_split().

8.Train LogisticRegression with specified hyperparameters and evaluate the model using metrics and a confusion matrix plot.
